# Keybow

Keybow is a 12 Key macro Keyboard by Pimoroni that I'm playing around with to create custom macros.

The language used for the default software is Lua, which is probably the worst language I've encountered so far, but hey, wouldn't be fun without a challenge...

The custom macros is found in the "custom_layouts" folder. All other files are default Keybow files that I keep in the project for reference and testing purposes.
